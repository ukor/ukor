It is interesting that the concept that made me fall in love with maths is the same concept that is making me hate mathematics,

Imagine a world where everything is possible, what is the value of `y` as `x` approach infinity? --- Infinity.

Should in case you are yet to figure out the concept I am speaking of, hopeful by the end of this read you would find it.

1/infinity = impossible = perfection

But what is infinity? 
Infinity is just as real as a unicorn or a dragon

Infinity is the largest number and also not the largest number, infinity is the number that you will never count to but still exist between any two numbers i.e 0 and 1.

Infinity is a concept that you and I will never know about.

If use an infinite amount of changes we can find the area of any object

1/infinity can be use to find the slope of a curve line 

A concept that does not exist is where we find existence - What a magical concept.
